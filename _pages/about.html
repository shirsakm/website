    <p>
        Hello! Iâ€™m a passionate and experienced freelance software developer from
        India with over 5 years of development expertise. As a full-time student and
        JEE aspirant, I adeptly balance my academic and professional pursuits,
        striving to make significant contributions to both fields.
    </p>

    <p>
        My journey in software development is marked by proficiency in a variety of
        programming languages and technologies. I possess maximum knowledge in
        Python and have solid experience with HTML, CSS, Rust, C++, C# (for Unity),
        and some Java. I am well-versed in full-stack web development and Python
        scripting, utilizing tools and frameworks such as Jekyll, Flask, Tkinter,
        and more. This diverse skill set enables me to tackle a wide range of
        projects efficiently and effectively.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some of my cherished programming projects include Maspas, a password manager
        developed with Tkinter and Python; Atno, a tool designed to help memorize
        atomic numbers and element details; and Bakeology, a website created for a
        small-scale bakery in Kolkata. Additionally, I have dabbled in Discord Bot
        development, with "The Rock Bot" being a notable project in this domain.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to my technical skills, I am a published author of the book "The
        Happiness Paradox," written for the BriBooks Summer Book Writing Festival.
        My problem-solving prowess has earned me accolades such as coming 2nd in the
        Farewell North Community Game Jam.
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond coding, I am an avid chess enthusiast, having competed in the 26th
        National School Games and securing 4th place in the 67th West Bengal State
        School Games for Chess. My intellectual curiosity extends beyond
        programming, as evidenced by my completion of Harvard CS50x and the UTAS
        Preventing Dementia MOOC, reflecting my deep interest in psychology.
    </p>

    <p>
        My problem-solving abilities and extensive experience with multiple
        programming languages have positioned me as a brilliant developer capable of
        delivering innovative solutions. My technical repertoire includes, but is
        not limited to:
